# RikiTraki

This repository contains the client code for [RikiTraki.com](http://rikitraki.com), a map-centric GPS track visualization web application.

The vision for this project is to create a free and open source and data capability for enabling a community of outdoor enthusiasts to share captured GPS tracks, visualize them over a variety of base maps as well as 3D terrain, and include useful descriptions and photographs of the destinations. The application can be used for mapping tracks of any outdoor activities such as biking, running and boating.

The server side code for the application is under the rikitrakiws repository [here](https://github.com/jimmyangel/rikitrakiws).

**RikiTraki is currently in beta release. Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated**
