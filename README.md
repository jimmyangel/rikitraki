# RikiTraki

This repository contains the code for [RikiTraki.com](http://rikitraki.com), a map-centric hiking log web application. 

The vision for this project is to create a free and open source and data capability for enabling a community of hiking enthusiasts to share captured GPS tracks, visualize them over a variety of base maps as well as 3D terrain, and include useful descriptions and photographs of the destinations. The application can also be used for mapping tracks of any outdoor activities such as biking, running and boating.

This repository contains the client side of the application. The server side is under the rikitrakiws repository [here](https://github.com/jimmyangel/rikitrakiws)).

**RikiTraki is currently in beta release. In order to post tracks to the site, an invitation must be requested at the registration dialog, - Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated**
